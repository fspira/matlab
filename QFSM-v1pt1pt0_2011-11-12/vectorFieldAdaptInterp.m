function Mi=vectorFieldAdaptInterp(M,Pg,d0,polygon,mode,alpha)
% vectorFieldAdaptInterp interpolates a vector field on a user-specified grid with adaptive kernel support
%  
%   For a vector field v:  
%      Interpolation with a correlation matrix K : <v> = K * v      (convolution)
%      where:  K = sG*exp(-(dx^2+dy^2)/d0^2), sG = weigth vector
%  
%   SYNOPSIS   Mi=vectorFieldAdaptInterp(M,Pg,d0,polygon,mode)
%  
%   INPUT      M       : vector field, stored in a (nx4)-matrix of the form [y0 x0 y x]n
%                        (where (y0,x0) is the base and (y,x) is the tip of
%                        the vector).
%              Pg      : regular grid points, stored in a (mx2)-matrix of the form [yg xg]m.
%              d0      : parameter for the weight function G=exp(-D.^2/(1+d0^2)),
%                        where D is the distance matrix between all grid
%                        points and all vector (base) positions.
%                        d0 must be a scalar.
%              polygon : (optional - pass polygon=[] to disable). The interpolated vector
%                        can be cropped to remove vectors outside a given region of interest.
%                        To create the polygon use the functions ROIPOLY or
%                        GETLINE. These functions return the polygon vertices
%                        stored in two vectors y and x. Set polygon=[x y] to
%                        use with vectorFieldInterp.
%              mode    : [ 'div' | 'strain' ].
%                        If 'div' is passed, the divergence of the vector field is used to 
%                        locally adapt the value of d0; if 'strain' is passed, the Frobenius norm
%                        of the strain tensor of the vector field is used.
%              alpha   : (optional, default = 1) d0 is locally adapted as d0(x)/(1+alpha*(m(x)/max(m)), 
%                        where m(x) is either the divergence or the norm of the strain tensor at position x.
%  
%   OUTPUT     Mi      : interpolated vector field.
%  
%   DEPENDENCES          vectorFieldAdaptInterp uses { vectorFieldDiv;
%                                                      vectorFieldStrainTensor;
%                                                      updateD0FromDiv;
%                                                      vectorFieldInterp}
%                        vectorFieldAdaptInterp is used by { }
